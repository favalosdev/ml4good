        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Context - Pretraining is not enough\n",
        "\n",
        "You've seen earlier in the course that we can train very large and performant models like GPT2 using next-token prediction. Such models, prior to any fine-tuning, must be steered carefully with prompts in order to generate useful output. Most language models used in services of any kind today are not only pre-trained models. Rather, we use many training techniques to make them more useful.\n",
        "\n",
        "RLHF is one of many techniques which can convert a pre-trained model, into a more useful model for practical application.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Context - RLHF as a naive alignment strategy\n",
        "\n",
        "The field AI alignment is concerned with aligning AI systems with our desired outcomes. There are many reasons to think that intelligent systems do not, by default, share human values or that whilst training against any objective will lead to reliable, expected outcomes being produced by AI systems. Nevertheless, training AI systems to produce outcomes that humans prefer over outcomes which they don't seems to be a concrete step towards AI alignment, which we can build on later.\n",
        "\n",
        "Thus we get the core idea of RLHF as an alignment strategy. We care about outcomes, so we provide the AI feedback based on what we think likely outcomes of it's actions are and update it to produce good outcomes according to our preferences.\n",
        "\n",
        "For more detail on RLHF, see Paul Christiano's blog post [here](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/vwu4kegAEZTBtpT6p/thoughts-on-the-impact-of-rlhf-research#The_case_for_a_positive_impact).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### What is RLHF?\n",
        "\n",
        "Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) is a RL technique where the rewards issued by a reward model, which is itself trained from labelled data from a human operator. Often, it can be hard to specify the reward function $R : S \\times A \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that the environment uses to issue reward to the agent, so we ask a human instead to reward/punish the agent based on the action it took. [OpenAI](https://openai.com/research/learning-from-human-preferences) uses RLHF to adjust the behaviour of models to desirable behaviour, but this can also incentivise the agent to hack the reward signal (by taking actions that look good to the human, or influencing the human to always give good rewards.)\n",
        "\n",
        "One should note that in the framework of RLHF, the environment only has one state, and the model that we are trying to fine-tune with RLHF no longer needs to \"plan ahead\", so in this sense it is closer to a bandit problem than the MDPs we saw in previous days.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why does it matter?\n",
        "\n",
        "RLHF (at the moment) is a successful method of nudging large language models towards desired behaviour when that behaviour is difficult to write as an algorithm.\n",
        "\n",
        "For chess, it's easy to evaluate whether an agent won/lost the game, so we can reward that directly. For text generation, it can be hard to formally specify\n",
        "what we mean by harmful or abusive text. One could have simple proxies like a filter to encourage/discourge use of particular words, and use that\n",
        "to train against, but it's very easy to construct harmful text such that no particular word in the sentence would be classed as offensive:\n",
        "\"I would love to eat your pet puppy\" contains no offensive words, even though the semantic meaning of the entire sentence is quite offensive.\n",
        "A simple proxy for offensiveness might even rate this as a positive statement, as it contains \"nice\" words like *love* and *puppy*.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, samples from humans are expensive and slow. Even running a single batch of examples through the model could take a long time\n",
        "if we need a human to give a scalar reward for each action chosen by the model. So, the solution is to collect a lot of data from a human\n",
        "(a set of (observation, action, reward) tuples), train a reward model on this data, and then use the reward model as the reward function.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### How does RLHF work in practice?\n",
        "\n",
        "RLHF involves 3 stages:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. We pretrain a language model (LM) using existing supervised learning techniques.\n",
        "2. We gather labelled data from humans, and train a reward model that will act as a proxy for the human's rewards.\n",
        "3. We fine-tuning the LM with reinforcement learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 1. Pretraining\n",
        "\n",
        "Since reinforcement learning is very sample inefficient, it is unreasonable to expect to be able to train a language model from scratch using online learning. Rather, we must start with an existing pre-trained model and then fine-tune it.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will be using GPT-2-small as our base model to finetune.\n",
        "\n",
        "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbloomAus/ARENA_2.0-RLHF/main/media/pretraining.png\" width=\"500\">\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. The Reward Model\n",
        "\n",
        "The reward model is used to assign a reward to any given output of the model during training.\n",
        "Rather than have reward be a simple function of the state of the world (as for RL environments like CartPole),\n",
        "the reward model assigns a reward to a given piece of text.\n",
        "The reward model acts like a text classifier, rewarding \"good\" pieces of text, and punishing \"bad\" text.\n",
        "\n",
        "The reward model is trained on a set of prompts, hand labelled by humans into \"good\" and \"bad\".\n",
        "This is then used to train the reward model, to act as a stand-in for the human during the fine-tuning stage.\n",
        "\n",
        "The model acts as a mapping between arbitrary text and human preferences.\n",
        "\n",
        "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbloomAus/ARENA_2.0-RLHF/main/media/reward-model.png\" width=\"700\">\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. Fine-Tuning with Reinforcement Learning\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, given some reward model and some pre-trained model, we can use an algorithm such as PPO to reward the model for producing prompt completions when the reward model predicts the completion to be preferable.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the standard RL framework, the agent recieves a reward on every timestep during interaction.\n",
        "Here, the \"observation\" that the agent receives is a textual prompt, and the \"action\" the agent takes is the choice of words\n",
        "to complete the prompt. The reward model then assigns a reward based on the prompt together with the completion from the agent,\n",
        "which is then used to compute the loss, and update the weights of the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbloomAus/ARENA_2.0-RLHF/main/media/rlhf.png\" width=\"800\">\n",
        "\n",
        "### How does RLHF differ from PPO?\n",
        "\n",
        "- No \"environment\". RLHF operates on text completions made by the pre-trained generative model.\n",
        "- Reward Model. Reward itself is generated by the reward model which itself must be trained.\n",
        "- Adding a Value Head. We add a value head to the policy/LM architecture so that we have both an actor and a critic for PPO.\n",
        "- KL Divergence penalty. The KL divergence term penalizes the RL policy from moving substantially away from the initial pretrained model with each training batch, to ensure we maintain coherent outputs, and the fine-tuned model avoids generating text that overfits to what the reward model is looking for.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Aside - value heads\n",
        "\n",
        "The \"actor\" in our PPO setup is the GPT model. We get the \"critic\" by adding a **value head** to the GPT architecture - i.e. you stick a classifier to GPT2 and train that as our value function.\n",
        "\n",
        "For an example, see the source code for AutoModelForCausalLMWithValueHead in the [TRLX github](https://github.com/CarperAI/trlx/blob/main/trlx/models/modeling_ppo.py). This gives us an autoregressive transformer which has 2 outputs: one corresponding to the standard next token prediction objective, and one which sticks a classifier on the end to get a value function. It does this by adding `self.v_head`, a function which reads from the final value of the residual stream in GPT (which stores some compressed embedding of the prompt), and extracts a value function from this representation. You can think of this as a kind of feature extraction, analogous to the feature extraction that we implemented with our ResNet models in the first week.\n",
        "\n",
        "The TRLX library we'll be working with today handles all of this under the hood. However, you should definitely have a poke around this library to get a feel for how it works.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Aside - KL divergence term\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note** - the KL div penalty is not the same as the version of PPO which uses a KL div penalty term in the surrogate objective function. The first one is a feature of the RLHF setup; it makes sure we don't get too far from the original model (i.e. it's static throughout training, used to constrain how much we change from the original model by the end). The second one is a feature of PPO setup; it makes sure we don't make huge updates from where we were before the last training step (i.e. it's a moving target, used to constrain how much we change each step).\n",
        "\n",
        "The KL div term we use in RL heavily penalises our new model when it outputs something which **would have low probability in the original model.** This is related to the reason RLHF'ed models are sometimes described as [\"lobotomized\"](https://twitter.com/repligate/status/1640488734192726018) - they converge to a subset of the kinds of outputs that our original model might have had, meaning they lose some of the variance and creativity of the original model.\n",

        "BERT predates GPT2 slightly (it was released in 2018, one year after the seminal \"Attention is all you need\" paper). It was the next in a proud tradition of naming transformers after muppets (no, [that's](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.13034.pdf) [not](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.09223.pdf) [a](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.12616.pdf) [joke](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.01604.pdf)). It has bidirectional attention, meaning we don't apply masking to the attention patterns - information can flow backwards and forwards in the model. BERT is usually used for classification tasks, such as sentiment analysis.\n",

        "* In NSP, we take two sentences, and train the model to predict whether the second sentence follows the first (we do this by adding a small classifier at the end of BERT, which just reads from the final value of the residual stream at the zeroth sequence position, which is a special classification token `[CLS]`).\n",

        "We usually stick a classification head onto the end of the \"core BERT architecture\" at the `[CLS]` token, then take the pretrained model and fine-tune it on a classification task. If pretraining has been successful, the model will have learned some kind of compressed representation of the input sequence in its residual stream, and the classifier will be doing something like feature extraction.\n",
        "\n",

There are times when this is insufficient and you might need to restart the kernel to free up memory, you can call `nvidia-smi` on your terminal to see how much GPU memory is currently being used, and you can run `watch -n 1 nvidia-smi` to constantly keep an eye on GPU utilisation & available memory.
